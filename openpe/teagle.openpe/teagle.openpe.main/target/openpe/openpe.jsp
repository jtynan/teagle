				<h3> Open Mobile Alliance Service Environment (OSE) compliant Policy Enforcer </h3>				
				
				<br/>	
				<p>
					The Policy Engine has been developed as a consequence of the increased necessity of the telcom world for a 
					system that provides a cost effectively and scalable management of the current resources and the future ones. 
					It has been designed as a policy based service broker for architectures based on the nowadays SOA systems requirements, thus 
					using the mechanism provided by the policy usage personalised services can be provided to end users and new services can be build
					upon the existing ones or the ones provided by third party companies.					    
				</p>
				<p>The architecture of the Policy Engine can be depicted in the following figure:<br/><br/>
